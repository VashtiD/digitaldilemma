        <td>In the story, dead actors are being didgitzed. In the text it states that "Instead of simply using CGI to
          create stunning action sequences, gorgeous backdrops, and imaginary monsters, film makers have started to use
          its technological wonders to bring back actors from the grave." This tells me as a reader that what's being
          digitzed is dead actor's and how they're being changed to something new</td>
        <td>The goal of digitizing is to bring back actors from the grave. In some cases, directors would recreate dead
          celebraties like stated "Paul walker" and etc to extend their roles in movies and shows. </td>

            <td>There are many good things about CGI digitizing, however many issues can occur like a hacker system or
              as stated in the text "Peter Cushing died in 1994. The film producers were faced with an interesting
              problem and ultimately decided to use CGI to digitally resurrect Cushing from the grave to reprise his
              role as the Imperial officer. The result of this addition of Grand Moff Tarkin in the final cut of the
              film sent shockwaves across the Star Wars fandom, with some presenting arguments in defense of adding
              Cushing’s character into the film by claiming that “actors don’t own characters” This is an issue that
              could occur because society wouldn't be happy if you recreated a dead actor to continue your film.</td>
            <td>There are some reasons why we use Digital representation because it is economical and easy to design.
              The worst thing about digitizing is that it could be dangerous because if you digitize someone, you must
              not mess with their looks because that would look horrible on you.</td>
